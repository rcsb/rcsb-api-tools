    There are two types of twinning: merohedral or hemihedral

    For merohedral twinning the diffraction patterns from the different domains are

    twinning. It only involves two distinct domains.  Pseudo-merohedral twinning is
    a subclass merohedral twinning in which lattice is coincidentally superimposable.

    In the case of non-merohedral or epitaxial twinning  the reciprocal
    lattices do not superimpose exactly. In this case the  diffraction pattern
    consists of two (or more) interpenetrating lattices, which can in principle
