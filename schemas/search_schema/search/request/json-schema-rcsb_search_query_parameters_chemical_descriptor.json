      "description": "Qualitative graph matching or fingerprint comparison criteria, with adding the aromatic criteria. The following graph matching searches use a fingerprint prefilter so these are designed to find only similar molecules. These graph matching comparisons include: graph-exact (atom type, formal charge, aromaticity, bond order, atom/bond stereochemistry, valence degree, atom hydrogen count), graph-strict (atom type, formal charge, aromaticity, bond order, atom/bond stereochemistry, ring membership and valence degree), graph-relaxed (atom type, formal charge, bond type), graph-relaxed-stereo (atom type, formal charge, bond type, atom/bond stereochemistry), fingerprint-similarity (TREE and MACCS). The following graph matching searches perform an exhaustive substructure search with no pre-screening. These substructure graph matching comparisons include: sub-struct-graph-exact (atom type, formal charge, aromaticity, bond order, atom/bond stereochemistry, valence degree, atom hydrogen count), sub-struct-graph-strict (atom type, formal charge, aromaticity, bond order, atom/bond stereochemistry, ring membership and valence degree), sub-struct-graph-relaxed (atom type, formal charge, bond type), sub-struct-graph-relaxed-stereo (atom type, formal charge, bond type, atom/bond stereochemistry)"
